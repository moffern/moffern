### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I started my C++ journey early 2021, been addicted since.

* ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on small projects from kernel/usermode to basic cpp.
  I also do some reverse engineering from time to time.
* ğŸ’» My goal is to hopefully one day be able to write my own anti-cheat and stuff
  like that. I find kernel/device drivers really interesting and fun to work with.
