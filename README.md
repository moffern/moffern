### Hi there 👋

* 🔭 I’m currently working on small "projects" in both kernel and usermode.
  I also do some reverse engineering from time to time.
  
* 🏆 My goal is to hopefully one day be able to write my own kernel anti-cheat and stuff
  like that, or atleast have the understanding/experience to know how to do so. 
  
* 📓 As im pretty new to most of this, im sure there will be alot of mistakes in my code,
  so if you see some bad code and/or want to share some thoughts -> moffern87@hotmail.com. 
  Any help is always appreciated!.
