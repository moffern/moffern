### Hi there 👋

* 🔭 I’m currently working on small "projects" from kernel/usermode to basic cpp.
  I also do some reverse engineering from time to time.
  
* 🏆 My goal is to hopefully one day be able to write my own kernel anti-cheat and stuff
  like that, or atleast have the understanding/experience to know how to do so. 
  And maybe even have a career within something related to this.
  
* 📓 If you see some bad code and/or want to share some thoughts, please do contact me. 
  Any help is always appreciated as i always want to learn more.
